# 🚀 Vertical Shoot 'Em Up

**VerticalShootEmUp** is a technical project built with **Unity 6** (or newer), showcasing the core mechanics of a classic vertical shoot ’em up.  
The goal of this project is to serve as a **playable demo** and an **example of game programming**, highlighting bullet patterns, enemy control, and foundational gameplay systems in Unity.
